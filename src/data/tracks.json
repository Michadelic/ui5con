			"abstract": "I admit, offline UI5 apps are not exactly 'WOW!'' - It's been done before, many many times. Except that… well I've done it many times according to the SAP Standards and using the SMP SDK. It’s tedious, and comes at a cost.So I figured: I can improve this. 1. First of all, if you're developing in openUI5, you don't always have an oData service in the backend. More often than not, you'll be limited to a JSON service. So the offline oData Plugin is not an option. More so since you need an SMP license and you might not be in an SAP environment. 2. Secondly, the SAP ERP data model is very ill-suited for data synchronizations. If you're not working on an SAP backend and you can still influence the data model, better do it right. 3. Thirdly, executing operations on UI5 models is cumbersome, since you need to access the entity using a path, pull the data out, call some function with the data, catch the result and move it back into the model-entity… Cumbersome… Bit by bit, we'll tackle each of these issues and introduce: Timesliced database, BusinessObjects (no, not businessObjects-analytics, but software represenations of a business object, as in OO), BusinessObjectModel, Local DB, Synch-model"

			"abstract" : "Web server, reverse proxy, ESLint, test runner, code coverage, continuous integration, minification, automated deployment - you will have to deal with most of these tools when you do serious SAPUI5 development. While SAP Web IDE already covers lots of these tools, it sometimes doesn’t give you the necessary flexibility, so we usually resort to Grunt – The JavaScript Task Runner. With Grunt's huge ecosystem, we can configure all of these tools and shape our workflow as we wish. But the configuration is cumbersome. Rather quickly, we end up with 20 or more Node.js modules that we need to make play together nicely so that we can eventually execute grunt serve or grunt build. In this session, you will get a glimpse at the tool and understand the concept and the problem it solves. You will also learn how to use the tool for your own project, so that you can focus in development, and not on tools."

Show the prototype or working repository and the content that we have aggregated so far"
